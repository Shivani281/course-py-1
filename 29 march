    "Q1. What is Lasso Regression, and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "Lasso Regression, short for \"Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator\" Regression, is a linear regression technique that introduces L1 regularization to the linear regression model. Lasso differs from other regression techniques like Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, Ridge Regression, and Elastic Net in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 Regularization: Lasso adds a penalty term to the linear regression cost function that is proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 norm). This penalty encourages some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection by eliminating less important variables. This is a key difference from Ridge Regression, which uses L2 regularization and only shrinks the coefficients toward zero without setting them exactly to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Lasso Regression can automatically select a subset of relevant features by pushing the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This makes it useful when dealing with high-dimensional data or when you want a simpler, more interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What is the main advantage of using Lasso Regression in feature selection?\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to automatically identify and select a subset of relevant features while setting the coefficients of irrelevant features to exactly zero. This feature selection process can lead to a more interpretable and efficient model. Some benefits of Lasso feature selection include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Model Simplicity: Lasso can create a more parsimonious model by eliminating unnecessary features, which can reduce overfitting and enhance model interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced Prediction Accuracy: By focusing on the most relevant features, Lasso can often lead to improved predictive performance compared to using all available features, especially when there is a large number of potentially irrelevant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identification of Important Variables: Lasso helps identify which variables have the strongest impact on the dependent variable, making it useful for variable selection in fields like biology, economics, and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. How do you interpret the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model?\n",
    "Interpreting the coefficients of a Lasso Regression model is similar to interpreting coefficients in ordinary linear regression. Each coefficient represents the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, assuming all other variables are held constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are some key points to consider when interpreting Lasso coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-Zero Coefficients: For variables with non-zero coefficients, you can interpret them in the same way as in ordinary linear regression. The sign (positive or negative) indicates the direction of the relationship, and the magnitude provides information about the strength of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Coefficients: Variables with coefficients set to exactly zero by Lasso have been effectively removed from the model. This means they are not considered important predictors of the dependent variable. Their inclusion would not affect the model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relative Importance: The magnitude of the coefficients can be used to assess the relative importance of the variables with non-zero coefficients. Larger absolute values indicate stronger effects on the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What are the tuning parameters that can be adjusted in Lasso Regression, and how do they affect the model's performance?\n",
    "In Lasso Regression, the primary tuning parameter is the regularization parameter, often denoted as \"lambda\" (λ). The λ parameter controls the strength of the L1 regularization penalty and thus affects the model's performance. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller λ values: When λ is small or close to zero, the regularization effect is weak, and Lasso behaves more like ordinary linear regression. In such cases, most coefficients are unlikely to be exactly zero, and the model might overfit the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Larger λ values: When λ is large, the regularization effect is strong, and Lasso tends to set many coefficients to exactly zero. This helps with feature selection and reduces the complexity of the model, making it less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the optimal λ value, you can use techniques like cross-validation or grid search, where you evaluate the model's performance for different λ values and choose the one that results in the best balance between bias and variance for your specific dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Can Lasso Regression be used for non-linear regression problems? If yes, how?\n",
    "Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique and is best suited for linear relationships between the independent and dependent variables. However, it can be extended for use in non-linear regression problems by incorporating non-linear transformations of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply Lasso Regression to non-linear problems, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Non-Linear Features: Transform the original features into non-linear forms, such as polynomial features, logarithmic transformations, or other relevant transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform Lasso on the Transformed Data: Apply Lasso Regression to the dataset with the transformed features. The Lasso penalty will still encourage sparsity in the coefficients of these transformed features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Lasso will select the most relevant non-linear transformations while setting the coefficients of less important transformations to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that while this approach can handle non-linear relationships to some extent, it may not capture highly complex non-linearities as effectively as dedicated non-linear regression techniques like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What is the difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression?\n",
    "The main difference between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression lies in the type of regularization they apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ridge Regression uses L2 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients (L2 norm) to the cost function. This penalty encourages all coefficients to be small but not exactly zero, leading to shrinkage without eliminating features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression uses L1 regularization, which adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 norm) to the cost function. This penalty encourages sparsity by setting some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Ridge Regression shrinks coefficients towards zero without eliminating any, while Lasso Regression shrinks coefficients and selects a subset of important features by setting others to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Can Lasso Regression handle multicollinearity in the input features? If yes, how?\n",
    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity among the input features to some extent. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables are highly correlated, which can lead to unstable coefficient estimates in ordinary linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Regression addresses multicollinearity by automatically selecting a subset of relevant features and setting the coefficients of irrelevant features to zero. This feature selection process can mitigate the multicollinearity problem because it effectively removes some of the correlated variables from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's essential to note that Lasso may not entirely eliminate multicollinearity if all correlated variables are equally important. In such cases, Ridge Regression might be more appropriate as it tends to shrink all correlated coefficients toward each other, but it does not set them to exactly zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. How do you choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (lambda) in Lasso Regression?\n",
    "To choose the optimal value of the regularization parameter (λ) in Lasso Regression, you can use one of the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Perform k-fold cross-validation on your training data, where you split the data into k subsets and train the Lasso Regression model on different combinations of training and validation sets. Choose the λ that results in the best performance, often measured using mean squared error, root mean squared error, or another relevant metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid Search: Define a range of λ values and evaluate the model's performance on a validation set for each λ. Choose the λ that leads to the best model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lasso Path: Use algorithms like coordinate descent or gradient descent to compute the Lasso Regression path, which shows how the coefficients change for different values of λ. You can inspect this path to determine the appropriate λ.\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods help you find the λ that strikes the right balance between bias and variance for your specific dataset, ensuring that your Lasso Regression model achieves good predictive performance while also performing feature selection effectively."
